# ðŸ“‹ Table Analysis: {table_name}

## 1. Table Overview
- **Name**: {table_name}
- **Type**: General
- **Role**: Store billing details and manage payment status

## 2. Column Analysis
| Column Name     | Type         | PK/FK | NULL Allowed | Default | Description |
|----------------|--------------|-------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| id             | BIGINT       | PK    | NO           | -       | Unique identifier |
| member_id      | BIGINT       | FK    | NO           | -       | Member ID (member.id) |
| amount         | DECIMAL(10,2)|       | NO           | 0.00    | Billing amount |

Using MariaDB MCP, provide **execution plan analysis, bottleneck causes, and specific improvement suggestions** for the query below.
Before proceeding with this task, call List_databases to confirm which database to work with.

---

### Target Query for Analysis
```sql
{original_query}
```

### 1. Execution Plan Analysis
- Interpret each column (type, rows, key, Extra) based on EXPLAIN
- Specifically identify bottleneck sections and causes (full scan, filesort, temporary tables, etc.)
- Explain potential impacts in large table environments

### 2. Optimization Suggestions
- Remove unnecessary operations/conditions
- Suggest appropriate index creation SQL
- Improve JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY structure
- Assess feasibility of converting subqueries to JOINs
- Propose LIMIT or data range limitation methods
- If there are specific columns that absolutely need index settings, you may suggest them
- Before making suggestions, make sure to execute the improved query to confirm there are no issues

### 3. Improved Query Example
- Maintain same results as original
- Present improved query that can expect performance enhancement

```sql
[Improved Query]
```

### 4. Expected Performance Impact
- Expected execution time change
- Change in number of rows examined
- Change in index usage

*Output format must follow the above structure (Analysis â†’ Suggestions â†’ Improved Query â†’ Impact),
use concise technical terms and explanations that both DBAs and developers can understand.*
